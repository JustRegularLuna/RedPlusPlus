## Setting up your own version

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md). This way you can build the latest dev version for yourself, or use it as a starting point for your own hack.
It is advisable to check the main Pokered repository as well for more info.

After setting up the repository, you'll want to download the current release of [**Polished Map**][polishedmap] by Rangi if you want to edit maps.
