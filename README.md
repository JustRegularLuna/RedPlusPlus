# Pokémon Red++ v4

Red++ serves as an updated and modernized version of Pokémon Red.
It is considered the prequel to [**Pokémon Polished Crystal**][polished] by Rangi.
The version here is actually based on a heavily modified copy of Polished Crystal's engine, instead of Red Version's engine the way previous versions were.

## Setting up your own version

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md). This way you can build the latest dev version for yourself, or use it as a starting point for your own hack.
It is advisable to check the main [pokered][pokered] repository as well for more info.

After setting up the repository, you'll want to download the current release of [**Polished Map++**][polishedmap] by Rangi if you want to edit maps.
